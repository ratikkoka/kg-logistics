    content:
      'Open Shipment is a method of transportation in which your car is transported on a carrier that is exposed to outside elements such as sunlight, rain, wind, dust, etc. It is a safe, secure, and affordable way of transporting your vehicle. For example, brand-new cars arriving at a dealership will use “open shipping” or “open carry”. \n\nEnclosed Shipment is a method of shipment in which the vehicle is transported in a trailer that completely surrounds and protects the vehicle from natural elements. It is often desired for owners of collector cars and used for luxury, vintage, classic, custom, and/or sports cars.',

    title: 'Do I need to be there for transport?',
    content:
      'You personally don’t need to be there, but it is highly recommended that you have someone you trust at both pickup and dropoff.\n\nBoth at pickup and delivery, you or your representative will need to inspect the vehicle and mark any damage on the Bill of Lading before signing it. At pickup, you should be looking for any pre-existing damage and at delivery, you can note any new damage that occurred during transport.\n\nIf you are unable to be present at either pick-up or dropoff, you can also arrange for both by leaving your vehicle’s key somewhere hidden on the vehicle, like on top of one of the tires or hidden under the seat, for example.',

    title: 'Can I store items in the car that is being shipped?',
    content:
      "Yes you can! As long as the items within the vehicle are secure and out of the way of the driver's area. We recommend using the space of the back seat and trunk/frunk, anything that goes above the window line is not recommended.\n\nNote: Personal belongings within the vehicle are not covered under the insurance.",

  {
    title: 'Will my vehicle be covered if something were to happen?',
    content:
      "Yes absolutely, you will be provided a certificate of insurance from the truck that will be transporting your vehicle should you request it from us. We only provide carriers with a minimum of 1 million dollars worth of insurance, and will go higher should the vehicle's value exceed that. Rest assured that your vehicle is in good hands.",
